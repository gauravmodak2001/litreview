        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            The Automated Literature Review System is a modular Python application designed to streamline the literature review process for researchers and students. 
            It leverages AI and natural language processing techniques to search for relevant academic papers, extract their content, assess their relevance, 
            and generate comprehensive literature reviews on any research topic.
        </p>
        <p>
            This system aims to save researchers time and effort by automating the tedious aspects of literature reviews while providing high-quality, 
            structured summaries of existing research.

        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-6">
                <h3>Step 1: Search & Retrieve</h3>
                <p>
                    The system uses a SearchAgent to find relevant academic papers across multiple sources including Google Scholar, arXiv, 
                    ResearchGate, and other academic databases. For each paper, it extracts basic metadata like title, authors, abstract, and publication details.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then, a ContentRetrievalAgent attempts to retrieve the full text of each paper when available, along with additional information 
                    such as keywords and citation counts.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-6">
                <h3>Step 2: Filter & Analyze</h3>
                <p>
                    A FilterAgent assesses each paper's relevance to the specified research topic and assigns a relevance score. 
                    Papers below a certain relevance threshold are filtered out to ensure the review focuses on the most pertinent literature.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The papers are then sorted by relevance, with the most relevant sources prioritized for inclusion in the final review.

                <h3>Step 3: Generate Literature Review</h3>
                <p>
                    Finally, a SummaryAgent synthesizes information from all the filtered papers to generate a comprehensive literature review. 
                    This includes:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>An introduction to the research topic and its importance</li>
                    <li>Overview of major themes and findings in the literature</li>
                    <li>Analysis of research methodologies used across papers</li>
                    <li>Synthesis of key findings and their implications</li>
                    <li>Identification of research gaps and future directions</li>
                    <li>A conclusion summarizing the state of the field</li>
                    <li>References to all included papers</li>

        <p>
            While the Automated Literature Review System is a powerful tool, it has some limitations to be aware of:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Access to papers behind paywalls may be limited</li>
            <li>The quality of results depends on the availability and accessibility of relevant papers online</li>
            <li>The system works best for academic topics with sufficient published literature</li>
            <li>Processing time varies based on the number of papers and their complexity</li>
            <li>The AI-generated review should be reviewed by a human researcher for accuracy and completeness</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            This system is designed to assist researchers, not replace critical thinking or expert knowledge in the field.
